The course is very transdisciplinary and you will encounter aspects of food web ecology, governance, economic decision-making and social network theory, among others. A common idea that links these different systems is that they are complex adaptive systems, and as such, they may display dynamics that are at times difficult to predict and provide additional challenges to governance.

The nomadic lifestyle responded to variation of climate and resources by moving the ”home” to a better place, e.g. south to get warmer, or to new areas where large animals where still plentiful. The primary mode of dealing with natural variation was responding to it by adaptation.  The more frequently environmental conditions became unfavorable and forced the group to move, the more the group became adept at tailoring its way of life to repeated breaking up, scouting for new living areas and making the transition. "},{text:"Humans ability to plan into the future is the prime reason we build infrastructures to increase the efficiency of desired dynamics. For example, to hunt animals at distances humans created spears and ”slungor”, and to drive herds into traps one had to clear areas, build fences or obstacles that routed the fleeing animals into the desired spot. Infrastructure’s primary purpose is to increase the predictability of outcomes. Having a spear increases the probability of killing an animal, fences, cleared pathways and obstacles increases the probability of getting animals to where you want them to be. Building a small dam in a stream increases the probability of plentiful water being available when needed. All in all, we use infrastructure to increase the predictability of resource provisioning. This amounts to decreasing the variability or at least to move the variability into a different time-domain. This infrastructure does come with a trade-off. At least for physical infrastructures (I will talk about cognitive infrastructures later), they are entities that need to be either transported or abandoned. This means that the more you invest locally in infrastructure to reduce environmental variability, the more you loose when you need to move. But also, the less often you have to move, the more you will invest in infrastructure. As you can see, we have a situation with circular reinforcements, high variability leads to less infrastructure with leads to high mobility proneness (less cost in lost infrastructure). Low variability leads to higher investment in infrastructure which reduces environmental variability. At some point, environmental variability is compensated for by infrastructure and the group sees less value in breaking up than in continuing building infrastructure. Fire and furs is a great way to compensate temperatures and is easily movable but a hut provides superior warmth and shelter but is place-bound. In terms of time invested, a fire may be one hour of wood collection, a fur one day of skin preparation and a hut 1-2 weeks of construction. "},{equation:"c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}"},{text:"Agriculture is often said to have provided the ultimate reason for abandoning nomadic lifestyles. We cannot say for sure, but agriculture certainly has the ingredients of infrastructure systems: investing in making a plot, redirecting a stream, improving soil, and storage for produce all serve to reduce environmental variability while making the cost of abandoning higher. Wether or not this was in our best interest can certainly be questioned, the lifestyle of a farmer is in many respects far harder and unhealthier than that of a nomadic person. "},{text:"From paper: Humans have a variety of different mechanisms that can allow them to increase their resilience in times of less than desirable agricultural production. Long-term social memory can allow humans to return to, or exploit with renewed intensity, foraged resources (42). Humans can use strategies based on diversification such as growing additional crops, developing fields in new environments, or using combined agropastoral systems that allow humans to exploit a variety of different niches (43). Humans can also combat risk by intensifying their agricultural production—producing surplus or by investing in landesque capital such as irrigation systems that can aid in buffering against one aspect of fluctuating climate and changing rainfall (43). Last, humans can also increase their resilience by specializing and by engaging in increasing networks of exchange such as those that developed during the early Silk Road or through state-sponsored technological innovations such as the Grand Canal."},{text:"As long as nomadic groups moved together, cognitive infrastructure moved together.

The major source of environmental variation where the perpetual change of climatic conditions, driven primarily glaciation cycles but also local climatic feedbacks as well as shifts in oceanic currents. These, in turn, drove plant and animal population changes over both space and time. Looking at global temperature reconstructions for prehistoric times one can spot a shift from large fluctuations to a period of remarkably stable trends in global temperatures during the Holocene."},{text:"The conclusion is that at some time during the holocene humans made the critical transition from dealing with environmental variability through mobility, to dealing with environmental variability with infrastructure. Once we made this transition, the only feasible way to deal with environmental variation was with more infrastructure."},{text:"The second conclusion is that infrastructure is build to address a certain level of an environmental factor and its degree of variability. The cost of environmental variability can be said to be moved from one domain into another. For example, most cities are along the coast and infrastructures such as roads, buildings, sewage systems, energy production systems are adapted to the expected level and variation of the sea. The infrastructure ensures that the city can keep functioning without any concern while sea levels vary with tides or storms. When the nature of the environmental variation changes, e.g. due to an unforeseen trend such as continuously rising sea levels due to polar glacier melting and thermal expansion of the oceans the cost are immense unless adaptation is built into the infrastructure system for this temporal scale.

Group identity is one such construct which is build in deep in human behavior. We can use symbols to identify groups of people which helps us choose appropriate behavior without having to inquire about the inner nature of each person. It also creates automated behavior and expectations (justified or not) for people not belonging to certain groups.

A simple way to think about value is benefit per effort. Trade is plausible when value is perceived differently between two parties. This difference can be due to perceived utility or due to the effort of attaining it. If we think about products, knowledge and infrastructure decrease effort of production. Thus it is easy to understand that two items with similar benefits but different production effort for person A and B respectively lend themselves to trade as perceived benefit per effort increases by the exchange. (Simple math version) "},{text:"A consequence of trade, however, is that the connection from the unit produced increases with one link. Consider the emotional difference between growing your own food or buying produce from a local farm, talking to the farmer and smelling the agricultural environment to that of buying the produce in the grocery store, only to possibly cast a quick glance from which continent the vegetable comes. But a much more important part of trade is that just as physical infrastructure often reduces environmental variability, trade as mediated by middlemen traders reduces price fluctuations. Price is a very efficient tool to gather information about supply and demand, or even, as discussed above, to supply per unit effort. This information holds vital information about the production capacity of the resource system."},{text:"Consider a simple regenerating resource for which the harvest produce is sold on a local market. Lets further assume that demand fluctuates due to population density or preference dynamics. Resulting from supply and demand mechanics the price will fluctuate resulting in changing demand as well as effort invested in production. While this mechanism does not lead to sustainable use of the resource by itself, it does contain vital information that can potentially be used to govern the resource. (Example from Tradable quotas?). But when middlemen aggregate multiple production locations before bringing the produce to consumers, this information becomes lost, at least for the local level. The consequence is that trade-markets become destabilizing for local resource use markets as the potential for feedbacks is removed."},{text:"Money is a way to value effort. In a society where most people have similar occupation, e.g. farming, husbandry, workmanship the time difference (effort) per utility produced may not be very different. By this I mean no one produces a product or service which utility as perceived by others is very disproportionate to the time it takes to produce this service or product. This is just a different way of saying that the money one receives per unit time spent in ones profession is about the same in a community with basic professions and un-hierarchical structures. "},{text:"For humans this is generally perceived as a positive thing. Prices as well as supply stabilize over time such that independent of season fresh apples or fish are always available. At least until the trade-network hits the ultimate boundary at the planetary scale, as is happening with fish stocks.
