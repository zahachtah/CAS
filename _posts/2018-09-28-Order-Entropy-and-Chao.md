Variation has a consequence. What is the place for all varieties? Which ties in closely to what generates varieties? But you may mostly ask:
why is he talking about variation in a post on order and chaos?

If a variety has a place, but is not in that place, we have entropy. If it is in the place it belongs to we have Order. The interesting thing happenes when a variety has no place. Then we have Chaos. When you come into your room, and you see that stuff is lying all around not in their places you have disorder, or entropy. But thats ok, if you know how to fix it. Just put everything back into its place. While the disorder is annoying, there is a given path towards order. You know what to do. You may not do it for many reasons, but still, its possible. But when you have stuff lying around for which there is no place. Maybe you move them from one area to another just to be irritated by it being in the way so you have to move it again. As this accumulates, you find yourself in chaos. It does not have an obvious way out. Or at least it requires a much more cognitive demanding process of first assigning a place and then putting it into its place. 

When we do science and we search for innovation we roam these fields of order, entropy and chaos. If you know how things work, you have order. A situation leading to a change is explained by a causality. When this does not happen, i.e. you get an unexpected change, your causality does not apply. Do we have disorder now or chaos?

when your brian sees a situation it generates expected outcomes from different actions. You can choose among these (well, at least in hindsight we tell ourselfes that we have the free will to choose) and it doesn't have to be the one with the highest expected outcome. But we cannot know much about this because we do not know our own inner value-function. We may think that the car we buy has the best requirements of speed, security and environmentability, but we are not aware of the fact that we also have one value function adding the image of yourself looking cool and attractive with that car.
