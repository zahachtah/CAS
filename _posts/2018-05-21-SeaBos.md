If theere is one natural resource that seems like an institutional nightmare to solve its the open ocean fisheries. The unregulated  seas with a huge potential for vast income just begs for a situation where the winner takes it all, i.e. empty the resource before anyone else will.

As a result, we have seen the open seas fisheries decline at alarming rates. How can one possibly solve such a situation? Hardin only had two solutions: State regulations (won't work as no naiton has jurisdiction) and privatization (won't work as no one owns the oceans). Luckily, we had Elinor Ostrom and some of her co-workers such as Marco Janssen and John Anderies deepening the problem of the common pool by studying actual cases in the real world. One common solution was that people can solve these problems because they talk (I know, who would have thought ðŸ˜±?).

So how does one apply that innovative solution to the open oceans? Henrik Ã–sterblom together with Carl Folke initiated a process in which they first identified the main corporate actors involved in open ocean fisheries and later invited these to talks about the future sustainable fisheries. Due to Complex adaptive systems proneness to develop powerlaws (aka inequalities) they quickly found that only a few coorporations where responsible for most of the fishing.

I may be biassed but I would like to emphasise that the following succes in talks between these mega-coorporations responsible for the future of our oceans was in part due to the communication and meeting fascilitation skills learned from long experience of transdisciplinary research done at the Stockholm Resilience Centre strongly helped develop this into a selfpromoting process that may well turn the tide for the decline of the open oceans ecosystem services.
