This year I am using a new platform and while I have put much effort into making it as good as I can, there may still be unforeseen obstacles that I may have to resolve as we go. Thus, some aspects of the website might change and feedback is much appreciated. Any comments and suggestions to the overall course experience can be written in the comments section on this page! </p><p>You can access all content for this course from this site. The navigation is simple: the large image at the top is the current topic. Below it is a row of smaller images that are sub-parts of the current topic (if there are many you will see an arrow indicating this so you need to swipe or click the arrow to access these). Clicking them makes them the current topic with sometimes with their own subtopics. To go back to the parent topic use the links at the very top left of the large image.</p><p>I will be on the forums at the bottom of each main page to check your questions and insights related to each part during the course. Don’t hesitate to ask and/or contribute!</p><p> To check out the timeplan of the course and ask questions about administrative issues, head over to the <b>Course Admin</b> section. The course will be released in four parts, i.e. all parts mentioned below are not available from start. This is to keep a similar but flexible pace for all students such that sharing your insights is most usefull for all.</p><p>Here's a quick reminder of the requirements for passing this course:<br><ul><li>You need to log in to the comments provider (see bottom of this page) using your prefered provider. Make sure your profile displays your name correctly please.</li><li>Present yourself and your educational background and why you want to take this course at the bottom comments section on this page </li><li>Under each main section, e.g. <b>Anthropocene</b> I want you to write down your own reflection, what triggered your understanding or insights from your personal perspective. Thus, I don't want a summary of  the topic, but your personal insights based on the educational background you have. By sharing these amongs each other we all learn by taking different perspectives.</li><li>There will be two essays to write, and I provide detailed instructions as we approach the dates for these (see Course Admin).

However, with a better understanding of the problems, the solutions have also become more clear, albeit workable ways to implement the solutions are often still lacking. Our fundamental understanding today is that human development and the health of the environment are interlinked and inseparable. Humanity must reconnect to the biosphere at all levels, not just locally. We will devote one part of the course to <b>Reconnecting</b> to the biosphere."

				"text": "This course gives an introduction into both social and ecological aspects of sustainability science. In the module <b>Sustainability</b> we will focus on what this term means, how it is can be envisioned from different perspectives, and what indicators are provided to guide the effort of achieving it. To guide you through the complexities of social-ecological systems, we are using several case studies to exemplify the core concepts and how they fit together. The course is very transdisciplinary and you will encounter aspects of food web ecology, governance, economic decision-making and social network theory, among others. A common idea that links these different systems is that they are complex adaptive systems, and as such, they may display dynamics that are at times difficult to predict and provide additional challenges to governance. In the module <b>Systems</b> we will talk about this and also how resilience thinking has become a core approach to dealing with these complexities."

In the module <b>Options</b> we will go through different approaches to creating change in social ecological systems, you will familiarize yourself with adaptive management, co-management, tax incentives and stakeholder participation among many others. Then in modules <b>Adaptive</b> and <b>Transformative</b>, from understanding the challenges of the Anthropocene, to understanding the governmental aspects of creating opportunities for sustainable living on a planet under continuously increasing pressure, we put the pieces together. We will look at how change is created, by adaptive governance, creating knowledge through stakeholder participation or connecting social networks through bridging or brokering agents."

The goal is to broaden the mind in regards to the problems as well as solutions to the human quest of living on this planet, to learn how one can start to address these and to provide knowledge that you can apply in everyday work and leisure settings. I'll leave you with a good reason to learn about these issues:"

You should have also gotten a good idea about: how humanity has become the driving force on the planet, how this has created new challenges for sustainability as we face increased population size as well as per capita pressure on the planetary resources and finally how ecosystems are in peril of having reduced capacity to provide the necessary services that we humans need. Furthermore, climate change is real and the impacts are becoming more evident. Together, these pressures create a planetary system which is unpredictable due to reduced resilience and increases in indirect feedbacks. We can expect many surprises in the future.</p><p>This calls for understanding the main limits of the planetary system that human activities need to be scaled within, if we want to be able to sustain human development. Those planetary boundaries provide a unique opportunity for change. For the first time in the history of humanity, we are on a scientific level aware of them, we have become stewards of the entire planet and thus governance needs to shift to the planetary level for these crucial targets.</p><p>Lastly, you should have gained an understanding that human globalization has created long-distance feedbacks, called “teleconnections”, between social and ecological system. Examples of such feedbacks include, changes in preferences in urban systems that drive global markets which can change local exploitation patterns, and climate feedbacks, such as deforestation leading to changed precipitation patterns that may change vegetation patterns in other parts of the world.</p>"

				"text": "Defining the system: The way we look at a system implicitly means that we define its border and treat the outside components as external. We do this because the rationale is that within system interactions are stronger than those to the external components. But this is a subjective border of the observer. Nevertheless, subjectively defined borders can improve focus on key mechanisms and help create an understanding of when external processes matter as drivers or even disturbances."
			},
			{
				"text": "System dynamics: Most systems of interactions can be grouped differently depending on the unit of measure. A consequence of complex systems and the fact that we put a subjective boundary for it is that it is prone to unexpected dynamics. One of the key properties of complex systems is the phenomenon of regime shifts, which essentially is a change in the dominance of different feedback loops. This has very large implications for management as it requires a focus on the interactions in the system rather than a focus on the actual state of the system. Many of these feedback loops are modulated by slow variables, changes in the ecosystem that occur through either slow integrative changes, through compositional change or through incremental changes in the network structure of the system. These can then trigger fast dynamics. But so can external factors which do not necessarily have to be governed by feedback loops, but through interdependence of different systems. A system that has undergone disturbance and disorganization is open for reorganization. Understanding resilience for the planetary scale creates a new challenge for governance due to its cross-national interdependence of feedback loops. "

This perspective has allowed human development to rely on huge energy and material resources. It has also created a lack of concern for our waste.

The main message is that in order to be able to create sustainability we must ensure that we have the necessary feedback from the environment into our social and economic systems. On a general level, this means bringing back the emotional and social attachment to the natural support systems of human life, not only food and timber, but also the regulating services that provide so much we take for granted. The concept of ecosystem services is one way to communicate the processes that are required to uphold human well-being in the long term. Landscape change is one important planetary boundary that has arguably the highest impact on the sustainability of ecosystem services. Try to understand the main causes of land use change since it is also directly linked to biodiversity loss. Biodiversity loss may well be the most pressing planetary boundary due to its irreversibility and its complex role in virtually every ecosystem process. If you understand the main causes of land use change, it also should become clear how food production systems are part of the loop that that needs to be closed for humanity to reconnect to the biosphere."

While governance often has the feel of top-down influence, stakeholder participation is part of the options for governance.

If there are no options to choose among then there can be no adaptive change. Different institutional or organizational arrangements are examples of <i>options</i>, for example fishing effort can be regulated by start and end of fishing season, restricted places, or restrictions in participants, such as licensing. Some options are incompatible and require a choice or replacement, while other combinations are complementary. For example, time-restrictions and place restrictions can work complementary, while restricting participants and local self-governance are options that are in conflict. With options comes uncertainties in their potential outcomes. Some are well tested, somewhere else or in past time, while others are novel and rely on imagination and understanding of the the current system."

But stakeholder participation can also can play an important role in dealing with inequity in power relations by ensuring the weaker actors have a voice. Furthermore, stakeholder participation is generally a good way to prepare for the implementation phase by creating a sense of shared responsibility for the changes made."

Furthermore, transaction costs of change provide an inherent threshold for change in any organization.

Progress can only occur by taking a change into the unknown. Exploitation thus involves experimentation; that is, processes of testing, evaluating, refining, and reapplying new forms of governance, institutional configurations, policies, and practices; within a given policy area. Such processes of trial-and-error are highly useful for coping with changing circumstances under high uncertainty but are also likely to be costly both in terms of benefits as well as the social transaction costs. In practical settings, the explorative capacity of a given community is reflected in the quality of its educational system and informational infrastructures, such as the existence of independent universities, research institutes, and “think tanks,” as well as arenas for public debate, science-policy dialogues and unbiased mass media. Exploration also entails having sufficient resources, such as physical, monetary, and human capital."

Hardin 2002), and the creation of institutional rules (Ostrom 2005) are all examples of mechanisms that can be called upon to ensure cooperation among actors in a governance system, as well as for keeping transaction costs on an acceptable level. Consequently, the strength of these mechanisms also determines the governance system’s capacity for exploitation."

				"text":"<h1>Adaptive Management</h1>Adaptive management is a form of environmental management that is predicated on the assumption that ecosystems are complex, self-organized, dynamic systems (Holling 1978, Walters 1986). Such systems (ecosystems or social ecological systems) are characterized by: a) large number of interacting variables and components, b) non-linear relationships among the components, and c) cross-scale interactions. The consequence of these characteristics is that great uncertainties limit tractability, analysis and predictability of outcomes, and system behaviors exceed the bounds of rational expectations. Rather than ignore or assume away such uncertainties, adaptive management was developed to confront complexity by posing questions or hypotheses to address uncertainty, then using management actions to evaluate these unknowns in order to learn about the complexities of system dynamics, as well as to achieve intended social objectives (Holling 1978, Walters 1986, Lee 1993)."
			},
			{
				"text":"Assessing a system requires synthesizing available data to generate a set of competing alternative explanations about particular sets of resource problems and social objectives. Management actions are designed by considering what actions are robust to uncertainties among alternative explanations and what actions will help test and winnow those uncertainties (Walters 1986). Management actions are evaluated by monitoring system indicators in a process that uses that information to promote learning."
			},
			{
				"text":"While these activities are described linearly, adaptive management is typically an iterative process that develops an ongoing dialogue about the functioning of the system and the goals of management. Thus, adaptive management consists of two activities; an assessment phase, which engages stakeholders to build integrative view of the system that leads to a set of hypotheses to evaluate. The second activity is to design, conduct and evaluate experiments that test the collective understanding of system dynamics and evaluate interventions and policy implementation."
			},
			{
				"text":"At least four key publications have proposed the ideas, provided methods, and reported on results of applications of adaptive management over the past four decades. These include Adaptive Environmental Assessment and Management (Holling 1978); Adaptive Management of Renewable Resources (Walters 1986) Compass and Gyroscope (Lee 1993) and Barriers and Bridges to the Renewal of Ecosystems and Institutions (Gunderson, Holling and Light 1995). Holling (1978) and Walters (1986) describe the use of computer models during the assessment phase of the process. These models are not used to predict the effects of policy actions on ecosystems, but rather as devices to clarify management objectives, highlight and winnow alternative explanations or hypotheses regarding resolution of resource issues. A suite of models are generally developed, each covering distinct spatial and temporal scales and are used as games to explore and reflect on understanding. Moreover, the models are used to develop policies that are structured as experiments to probe the identified uncertainties. Lee (1993) and Gunderson et al. (1995) describe how adaptive management has been attempted in large-scale resource systems. Lee (1993) focuses on social, political and institutional constraints on experimentation in the Columbia River Basin. The Gunderson, Holling and Light (1995) publication compares similar patterns of change in managed resource systems. The pattern is such that management that stabilizes key ecological processes (populations, water flows) inevitably leads to a type of crises (ecological, economic or social). Following a crisis, informal groups collaborate, to resolve the crisis by developing an integrated understanding (often an adaptive assessment). Finally, such assessments lead to transient learning processes that result in a reorganization of the management institutions and society, with new goals and policies in place."

Some authors argue that it involves the management of complex <b>social</b>-ecological interactions characterized by high degrees of uncertainty (Dietz, Ostrom, & Stern, 2003). Folke et al. (2005) describe this form of governance as necessary for the management of complex ecosystems, particularly when change is “abrupt, disorganizing, or turbulent. Brunner et al. (2005), provide a rich set of examples to illustrate the emergence of adaptive governance as a way of solving problems created by top-down control of decision making and attempts at implementation of singular scientific and technical solutions that are bereft of political considerations. They describe adaptive governance as operating in a situation where the science is contextual, knowledge is incomplete, multiple ways of knowing and understanding are present, policy is implemented to deal with modest steps and unintended consequences and decision making are both top-down (although fragmented) and bottom-up. As such, adaptive governance is aimed at integrating science, policy and decision-making in systems that assume and manage for change, rather than against change. Moreover, adaptive governance attempts to overcome obstacles to the implementation of adaptive management."

This online resurce has taken the perspective that social ecological systems are complex adaptive systems (CAS), and as such this controversy is irrelevant, as both aspects are part of what create the dynamics of CAS.

In research on resilience, the concept has become highly relevant for studying the role of key individuals in bringing about transformations for sustainability (Westley et al. 2013). The importance of individual agency has been highlighted in several evaluations of the factors leading to shifts to ecosystem-based and adaptive management (Fabricius et al. 2007). But sustainability transformations are not just the product of a single individual’s vision and steering; rather, they require systemic shifts in institutional underpinnings such as mental models, management routines, and resource flows (Westley et al. 2013). Such shifts are often multilevel and multiphase processes, involving a variety of actors pursuing strategies that are attuned to opportunities arising from dynamic changes occurring within the system they are seeking to transform."

				"text": "One current field of research is the relationship between different strategies and techniques that actors utilize, and the broader system dynamics that shape the context in which they are working under. This research emerges from research on linked social-ecological systems (Olsson et al. 2004) and connect these to literature on entrepreneurship (social, policy, and institutional), which examines the role of strategic agency in the transformation of complex adaptive systems generally (Westley et al. 2006)."

			{
				"text": "The notion that individual agency can be vital in shaping the dynamics of broader systems taps into a long-running debate in the social sciences about the primacy of leadership versus non-directed, iterative change in causing systemic shifts (Emirbayer and Mische 1998). The literature on SES straddles this divide. It contains forceful arguments that complex social-ecological systems cannot be governed by the top-down, command and control forms of management sometimes associated with conventional ideas of leadership (Gunderson et al. 1995). At the same time, SES research contains case studies showing strong evidence of the role of individual agency in achieving transformations from less adaptive to more adaptive management and governance systems (Olsson et al. 2006). This incongruity, in which one set of observations suggests that conventional leadership of SES is ineffectual and another identifies agency as a crucial factor in transformations for adaptability, suggests a new framework is needed to explain the role of agency in SES transformation."

			},
			{
				"text": "Drawing on a set of case studies, Folke et al. (2003) tested this assumption in SES, and identified numerous actor groups engaged in their stewardship: knowledge carriers and retainers, stewards and leaders, interpreters and sense makers, networkers and facilitators, visionaries and inspirers, innovators and experimenters, and followers and reinforcers. These change agents demonstrate a variety of skills seemingly required for transforming such complex, linked systems."

				"text": "<h1>Agency, entrepreneurship, and/or stewardship</h1>The findings from the field of ecosystem stewardship are echoed in the small but growing body of work in management and organizational studies concerned with the role of strategic agency in complex and interorganizational domains (Westley et al. 2006). Like the SES literature, this research explores agency at the broad system scale, in what might be termed the “problem domain”. A problem domain is made up of the actors, organizations, and institutions concerned with or affected by a particular complex problem, and thus includes actors working at different organizational, jurisdictional, and geographic scales. When exploring the transformation of ecosystem management, the problem domain involves the local communities, management agencies, NGOs, corporations, government actors, indigenous groups, scientists, and actors who are invested in the future of that ecosystem, and provides a useful term to describe the social aspect of an SES."
			},
			{
				"text": "The literature on agency in such problem domains argues that strategic agency is pivotal in moving a process of transformation forward. Within complex problem domains, however, strategic agency is typically not associated with just one individual, rather it is produced through the strategies of a number of actors, each of whom takes actions that help the system progress through different stages of innovation and transformation (Westley et al. 2013). This kind of effort is more precisely defined as “institutional entrepreneurship,” a concept developed first by DiMaggio (1988) to describe the efforts of individuals who seek to change the institutions governing a particular domain in the interests of realizing particular goals of their own."
			},
			{
				"text": "Shifting from the notion of leader to that of entrepreneur usefully moves focus from the leader-follower relationship to the endeavor itself, and to the imperative of seizing opportunities and mobilizing resources that will gain support for innovations critical to transformations of social-ecological systems. Similarly, shifting the focus to the institutional level from the organizational leader allows us to see the importance of cross-scale interactions and the challenge of transforming the value system, economic system, and political system that supports non-sustainable approaches to ecosystem stewardship. This focus is more in keeping with our understanding of emergence and change in complex adaptive systems (Westley et al. 2006). We will therefore refer to institutional entrepreneurs in our discussion of agency for transformation in complex social-ecological systems."

The Coral Triangle is a unique marine area and a biodiversity hot spot located in the Western Pacific Ocean. More than 120 million people live in the Coral Triangle and rely on its coral reefs for food, income, protection from storms and a number of other ecosystem services. In 2007 the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) was formed as a multilateral partnership of six countries to address the urgent threats facing these unique coastal and marine ecosystems."

It includes the Indonesian president, a series of international conferences, NGOs, donor agencies, informal networking, trust building, lobbying and diplomacy. They all interacted over a period which can be divided into four different phases. The transition from one phase to another was enabled by certain key events. Phase one introduced the new idea of the CTI to the highest political level by drawing on formal and informal networks. It was followed by a second phase focused on mobilizing funds and support, in collaboration with President Yudhoyono who officially initiated the partnership. In phase three the preparing for the first high-level meeting between the six countries was given central attention. This included conceptualizing what the CTI could look like and preparing drafts of central steering documents. This proved to be key to succeed in the fourth phase where the deal was sealed during a whole series of multilateral and national meetings, arranged to develop legal and financial arrangements necessary to implement the initiative."
			},
			{
				"text": "The study revealed that a small network of approximately ten institutional entrepreneurs was key to initiate the process. They developed the scientific concept of the CTI into an integrated framework for marine governance. This framework not only requires the six states to multiply their cooperation and carry out far-reaching institutional reforms, but also a mind shift — viewing ecosystem-based management and marine conservation not primarily as a cost, but rather as an investment in sustainable economic development and national security. These ten entrepreneurs came from both inside and outside the region and predominantly, but not solely, from conservation NGOs with a long history of working with marine conservation. They all had extensive experience in dealing with resource challenges or with bringing governments and non-state actors together for better marine conservation. Moreover, it was revealed that all of them had advisory or managerial positions in their organizations, meaning that they could access financial resources and use already existing local to global networks to scale up their ideas. The study concludes that institutional entrepreneurs can only succeed by interacting with other forms of leadership, such as the strategic leadership of the Indonesian President Yudhoyono or the orchestrated action of donor agencies and international NGOs."
			},
			{
				"text": "On another level, the process of developing the CTI has been triggered by a number of underlying driving forces, including demands for social and economic development, concerns about political stability and national security, and rapid loss of biodiversity — particularly commercially important species. Together these factors seem to have opened a window of opportunity for the new institutional arrangements for ecosystem-based management and regional cooperation to emerge. Institutional entrepreneurs played a crucial role by aligning factors and showing the interconnectedness between social and ecological goals. In particular, it seems like the support from the six countries of the CTI is based on the initiative’s connection to a range of security concerns, revolving around things like food crises, economic deprivation, terrorism and illegal fishing."

It certainly has powerful implicaitons for changing both local and regional policy and general course of actions. But there are also some risks associated that are important to be aware about (Blythe et al. 2018):<ul><li>The transformation approach may lend governments to shift the burdon of action to vunerable parties. For example when anticipatory transformative action is expected on climate impacted communities while both the burdon of cause as well as the responsibility of consequence should be on the governing bodies</li><li>There is a risk that using the term transformation which is generally (still) positively regarded does not preclude hidden power agendas. I is worth reminding oneself that many ill-fated social experiements in history have some processes in common with the transformative approach. </li></ul>But transformation will always be a tool in humanities array of change-mechanisms. With inclusiveness and transparent stakeholder participation and selection many problems can be avoided which may further enhance the legitimacy of changes that result from such a transformation"

				"text": "Ecosystems do not abide by human-made jurisdictions and administrative borders, and it is therefore not possible or feasible to divide them into separate, self-supporting, autonomous components. Furthermore, many of the services they provide are common pool resources with multiple actors competing for use, often leading to resource depletion or management conflicts (Hardin 1968). Hence, management of any given resource would benefit from actors agreeing on common rules and practices, coordinating usage, engaging in conflict resolution, negotiating various tradeoffs, sharing information, and building common knowledge (Folke et al. 2005). Research shows that top-down centralized management is poorly suited for this (Holling & Meffe 1996; Folke et al. 2005). Attention has therefore been directed at governing systems where multiple actors to various degrees are involved in the governing processes. However, making multiple actors collaborate is not a trivial task (Ansell & Gash 2007)."

				"text": "Recent research has identified the existence of often informal social networks as a common and important denominator in cases where different stakeholders have come together to effectively deal with natural resource problems and dilemmas (Scholz & Wang 2006). Having a large group of actors connected through a collaborative social network does not, however, by itself imply that collaboration will be effective. This for example applies if the group is large and coordinating activities among a large set of actors therefore becomes challenging (Provan & Kenis 2007). This lead to an increasing recognition of agency and leadership (Westley et al. 2013)."
			},
			{
				"text": "In the context of resource management, where the managed ecosystems span across boundaries, this becomes increasingly challenging since the actors typically are quite different (fishermen, government agencies, private corporations, NGOs, etc.). Bringing such a heterogeneous set of actors together is a different challenge compared to coordinating actors of the same type. This is where the notion of bridging and brokering organizations becomes particularly relevant. A bridging organization is an organization that brings a diverse (and often large) set of actor together. This is typically achieved through informal structures of collaborations, often relying on social (organizational) networks (Hahn et al. 2006). In the next section we provide an example of how a bridging (brokering) organization help to achieve a substantial reduction of unregulated, unreported and illegal fishing in the Southern Ocean, by effectively coordinating a diverse set of actors and functions."

CCAMLR member states include countries with Antarctic claims, with nationally sovereign territories (Sub-Antarctic islands) and other countries with research or fishing interests in the region. CCAMLR was established after the substantial depletion of several species of whales and finfish, and during a period when there was a rapid increase in the interest to harvest Antarctic krill (Österblom & Sumaila 2011)."

A number of vessels previously engaged in e.g., tuna fishing started to appear in the CCAMLR area – several of which had no license to fish in this region. The vessels were primarily catching Patagonian toothfish, a cod-like predatory fish which was gaining popularity, for the US market. Analyses by CCAMLR scientists showed that such illegal fishing was several times higher than the small, but developing licensed catch of toothfish, and there was a substantial risk of stock collapses. Toothfish were caught on long-lines with baited hooks, which also caught globally threatened albatross seabirds. Scientific estimates indicated that such catches were at a level where these populations were severely threatened."
			},
			{
				"text": "Based on data collected from environmental NGOs, it was clear that several vessels operating illegally in the CCAMLR area were flagged to CCAMLR member states, which means that they have the responsibility for them. This created a sensitive political situation and it became increasingly clear that CCAMLR, an organization where decisions are taken in consensus, would be unable to effectively develop policy measures to address the problem. Instead, environmental NGOs, in collaboration with the licensed fishing industry, mobilized to collect more information on illegal operators, engaged in monitoring activities and developed alternative policy measures. The information collected was published in local newspapers (where known illegal operators lived), fishing media outlets and in reports presented to CCAMLR by NGO-observer organizations. Thus, they established themselves as broker organizations making critical information available to both member states and the general public at that specific point in time. These informal naming and shaming strategies initially proved very effective and led to a reduction of illegal fishing activities. However, a few years later, illegal fishing levels increased again. This time, the license industry was better organized and took on the role as data collector and information sharer. The industry established the Coalition Of Legal Toothfish Operators (COLTO), and was able to gain observer status to CCAMLR. Through similar naming and shaming strategies and political lobbying, COLTO was able to contribute substantially to a second reduction of illegal fishing."
			},
			{
				"text": "The political pressure that NGOs and the industry had mobilized, the information that they had collected and the proposals for policy measures that they had developed, contributed to the necessary decisions in CCAMLR. The Commission agreed on developing an illegal blacklisting of vessels, established an electronic traceability system for toothfish catches and a joint vessel monitoring system. These actions together enabled the CCAMLR secretariat to operate as an officially sanctioned bridging (broker) organization, with formal protocols for how to use and distribute information coming from governments, environmental NGOs and the licensed industry. The secretary thus act as the “spider in the web” bringing all these actors closer together."

Also, the process depends largely on the social scale we are looking at, whether it is one person, a group with a shared goal such as in management or if it involves multiple stakeholders or levels of governance. For the latter, all four points can vary among participating groups and there is a social process involved, including deliberation, power relations and social influence.

When a control option is given (taxation/subsidies) we can easily find out how to choose it in order to find the socially desirable outcome. But most systems that provide us with the utility we want are complex adaptive systems and thus non-linear and unpredictable.

From 0-20 stock growth increases because the more fish you have, the more fish are reproduced per year, and are add to the next year’s stock. Between 20-40 growth decreases (but is still positive) due to the fact that food or habitat resources for the fish become limited."

However, stock size may vary due to many reasons, such as predation from other species or fluctuations in food sources. What would we do if the stock was 10? Economic theory says that for this simplified case, we should do whatever it takes to bring back the stock as fast as possible to 20 and then keep taking 5 each year. This means not harvesting at all until the stock goes above 20 next year and then only take whatever is needed to keep it at 20. But what if the growth rate changes?"

For example, as a farmer in the sub-saharan region, one is faced with a probability of low rainfall any year. But over time (and ignoring climate change trends) the risk of a dry year can be estimated. So, should one plant a high value crop that is drought sensitive or a low value crop that can tolerate drought? You can imagine that this decision depends on your alternatives. If you have an alternative income which you can use to buy food from local markets, then the first option might seem sensible. If a successful crop is the only food you will have for your family, then the second option is the most sensible. What we describe here are different risk aversions. Let’s say that the utility from growing a crop is given probability p of no drought.<p> $$U=p C_{normal} + (1-p) C_{drought}$$ </p>If we knew the probability of drought (say 20%) and the yields of two different crop types under [normal/drought] to be for drought resistant type [10/5] and drought sensitive type [20/0] we could calculate the expected yield as 9 for the drought tolerant type and 16 for the drought sensitive type. If you don’t care about risk, then the second option is clearly better. But if it is more important to get any crop than maximum crop your strategy would be different. This has to do with risk aversion."

Should it lead to more or less precautionary behavior compared with a case with no regime shift? (Polasky et al 2011). The dilemma is that there is typically a trade-off between precaution and efficiency<ul><li>On one hand we must be careful not to end up in a really nasty situation (precautionary principle)</li><li>On the other hand staying too far away from a possible regime shift can result in lost opportunities and decreased welfare (efficiency argument). Postponing actions implies trade-off between learning first and acting first (option value)</li></ul>"

(2011) shows that two factors that influence the answer to this question are whether the manager’s actions actually can influence the probability that the shift occurs and whether the regime shift leads to a total collapse of the stock or if it only changes the renewal dynamics of the stock. <br>Firstly, if the manager can actually influence the probability that the shift occurs, it seems reasonable that the manager accounts for this in their decisions and tends to behave more precautionary. In contrast, if a manager does not influence the probability of a shift, a precautionary behavior will then not lead to any potential gains and is not motivated.<br>The second aspect is the question of how dramatic the regime shift is. If there is a risk of an irreversible fish stock collapse, there is some rational in trying to exploit the stock as much as possible before it disappears. Hence it also matters whether the regime shift leads to an irreversible collapse of a stock for example or rather changes the dynamics of resource renewal."

Thus, in addition to broadening and enhancing the available sources of relevant knowledge as base for decision making, a MEB approach aims at enhancing trust and avoiding the arrogance of a single ex ante “right approach,” which frequently overrides the contribution of indigenous peoples, local communities, and practitioners in the context of assessment programs and development projects."

Initially, regional and thematic workshops have been organized to identify indicators relevant for indigenous peoples, towards monitoring local to global progress in achieving internationally agreed environment and devel- opment goals, such as the indicators related to traditional knowledge for the Aichi biodiversity targets.

As part of this, there is a need for innovative ways for dialoguing and meeting, as well as new tools and understanding of e.g. combining qualitative and quantitative data and scaling knowledge across scales.

Scenario planning is a systematic method for creatively analyzing complex futures. A scenario is an internally consistent and plausible narrative about the future that is informed by existing conditions and processes, as well as potential future ones (Enfors et al. 2008). Scenarios describe futures that could be instead of futures that will be, focusing on important uncertainties in the system rather than on the accurate prediction of a single outcome."

Scenario analyses have been widely used over the past 50 years. Initially developed by response to the difficulty of creating accurate forecasts in the petroleum industry, one of the most well-known examples of scenario planning as a strategic management tool comes from the Shell Oil company, which in the early 1970s used scenario policy planning to respond to the 1970s oil crisis (Peterson et al. 2003). Scenario planning can take many different forms, and it is important to select a scenario planning process that fits the purpose of the project. Scenario-planning can be participatory or expert led to varying degrees (van Notten et al. 2003), and performed from local to global scales, or sometimes across scales (Biggs et al. 2007)."

A Stakeholder Analysis was done by local experts following a criteria and ranking exercise to describe the stakeholders Importance (e.g. the extent to which a stakeholder’s wellbeing is either directly or indirectly affected by governance of and/or access to coastal ecosystems), Influence (e.g. a stakeholder’s level of agency to affect change in the management of coastal ecosystems and influence the livelihoods and wellbeing of stakeholders with a high importance) as well as the type of knowledge held by each individual."

The spatial boundary was defined as - From and including Mombasa to the Tanzanian border. It includes the seas and about 10 km inland. It includes urban and rural areas.

Facilitators assisted the discussions to also make sure that “surprises” and “events” were added to the final round of factors shaping the future system.

One advantage of scenario planning is that it can incorporate a wealth of information from a variety of disciplines and knowledge systems, and although dealing with complex system dynamics, the outcome is often easily accessible for scientists as well as policy makers and lay people (Kok et al. 2007). Similarly, scenario planning can account for different values and perspectives on what attributes of a system are most important. By highlighting these different representations and values of the system, the scenario planning process can also become a platform for conflict resolution and increased collaboration between different groups of stakeholders. If organized and applied well, scenario-planning process can become a powerful tool for learning, consensus building (alignment of goals), and public action, which can make people better at preparing for and shaping their future (Wollenberg et al. 2000)."

Humans ability to plan into the future is the prime reason we build infrastructures to increase the predictability and efficiency of desired processes.

These infrastructures worked for a in the pre-holocene mobile lifestyle as they could be brought along or used seasonally. Infrastructure’s primary purpose is to increase the predictability and efficiency of desired outcomes. Having a spear increases the probability of killing an animal, while fences, cleared pathways and obstacles increases the probability of getting animals to where you want them to be. Building a small dam in a stream increases the probability of plentiful water being available when needed. All in all, we use infrastructure to increase the predictability of resource provisioning. This amounts to decreasing the variability or at least to move the variability into a different time-domain, for example, there is a low chance that a dam bursts but a high chance it will provide benefits at any given time. Howeever, building infrastructure does come with a trade-off. Physical infrastructures are enteties that need to be either transported or abandoned (at least temporarily) in a nomadic lifestyle. <p>"

This difference can be due to perceived utility or due to the effort of attaining it.

If two people exchange e.g. food for construction material, based on their differences in value per effort, the personal experience of producing one of these items are lost for each person respectively. But since a social connection is established an indirect link still exists, one may for example ask how the harvest of wheat was this year and exchange some smalltalk on how far one has to walk these days to find decent wood for construction.

In this approach the economic system is seen as a sub-system of the social system which in turn is a embedded in the ecosystem (biosphere). <b>Human well-being is the normative goal, while economics and social processes provide tools for achieving it and the biosphere provides non-negotiable conditions and frames.</b>"

			},
			{
				"text": "Sustainability can thus be defined as a condition where human well-being does not decrease over time. This definition is very general. It implies, for example, that the flow of goods and services from different types of capital contributing to well-being must be sustained over time. There are four broad types of capital: <b>natural, physical, human and social. Natural capital</b> includes everything from the biosphere - ecosystem goods, services and underlying functions - as well as minerals from the lithosphere. <b>Physical capital</b> include houses, infrastructures, all things produced by people. <b>Human capital</b> means knowledge; the better knowledge we have the more value we get from using natural and physical capital. <b>Social capital</b> is the level of trust and reciprocity in a society. The higher social capital, the higher our capacity to organize ourselves to innovate, adapt and transform towards more sustainability. Hence, both human and social capital are important to get as much sustained wellbeing as possible from the natural and physical capital stocks."

				"text": "Historically most societies have degraded natural capital to invest in physical capital. Human well-being has increased in almost all parts of the world despite a degradation of natural capital, sometimes refered to as the “<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/60/8/576/304804\"> Environmentalist’s paradox”</a>. Human capital has expanded through education. Social capital has changed in different directions and is generally associated with peace, democracy, equity, income level, income equality and low corruption. An important question is to what extent the different capital types are substitutable. How long can we continue degrading natural capital to enhance other types of capital and claim this will benefit future generations? This does not mean that all consumption included in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is unsustainable; some consumption patterns do not degrade natural capital. How tradeoffs are made between the different capital types in the interest of maximizing human well-being are the tasks of science and politics, or ultimately the task of every person."

			{
				"text": "Another important source of conflict is whether it’s ethical view ‘the environment’ as goods and services that people can consume according to their individual tastes, or if we have a moral obligation towards future generations to sustain the biosphere in a good condition.There have been various approaches used in an attempt to value nature. Scientific attempts to value nature are often based on the former: people are asked how much they are <i>willing to pay</i> for various environmental goods and services. This assumes two things: the full substitutability of the goods and services and that sustainable development is a matter of choice by individual consumers. The second approach to valuation assumes that sustainable development is a matter of choice by citizens and that it concerns human rights issues, just like democracy. In political science, human rights and democracy are ‘overarching ideologies’ that people can agree on regardless of if they belong to the political left or right. These constitutional rights provide direction, frame and constraints to other legislation which in turn provide direction, frame and constraints to policy options as well as choices by consumers. Sustainable development has a very strong ethical foundation and it could, if we want, have the potential to be put in the same ‘constitutional’ category as democracy and human rights."

Thus, as we begin to make sustainability more specific using different approaches from different disciplines, we are also able to highlight and hopefully resolve important controversies.

Let’s also assume that W depends on many things (as we discussed in the previous section), but let’s begin by grouping this into financial (F), human (H), natural (N), social (S) or physical (P) capital such that we can define well-being as W(F,H,N,S,P). With this sweeping simplification Ken Arrow and colleagues argue that to calculate intergenerational well-being, i.e. from now and into the future, we just sum the well-being over time and add a discounting rate (d) so that well-being in the near future is valued higher than well-being in the more distant future."

We are, however, left with the quite complicated task of actually defining W(F,H,N,S,P), as well as how the capital stocks work and relate to each other. We have already hinted at the issue of what extent different capital types are substitutable. How much can we continue degrading natural capital to enhance other types of capital and claim this will benefit the wellbeing of future generations? According to the ‘strong’ definition of sustainable development, the stock of natural capital must not be reduced over time. The argument is that the goods and services from natural capital can only to a small extent be replaced by other forms of capital. The ‘weak’ definition of sustainable development is that the sum of all capital stocks should not be reduced. This allows for substitution between the capital types. The argument is that as long as we avoid thresholds, we can continue degrading natural capital if the negative human well-being effect is more than compensated for by increasing other types of capital. This is what we have done all throughout our history and surely our well-being today is higher than hundred years ago. But will it continue to be so? Have we already passed some irreversible threshold setting future well-being on a declining trajectory?<br>In the next section, valuing the future will talk more about the use of discounting rates to estimate the potential value of goods and services in the future."

When we defined intergenerational well-being above it looked very static. In reality, human actions change the flow from capital stocks, some intentionally, some unintentionally and some through interdependency between capital stocks. For example, to ensure efficient human capital, people need to be healthy and productive. However, if you take production capital into consideration, such as machines, energy or information, production may produce pollutants, and as a side effect reduce human capital through reducing life expectancy or increasing extended sick leaves. Thus, in reality,the production units of the different capital types form an entangled and sometimes very complex web of interactions. Unraveling this web, piece by piece, through scientific studies of important linkages is an ongoing research field. Notable efforts include the DICE and RICE models, the PAGE model used in the Stern review PAGE, as well as IMAGE.

Understanding the concept of sustainability described above, and the complexities of interrelations among production units of this well-being, is important for policy-making. While some attempts are made at integrated models as mentioned above, the scientific community is working on many of these relationships with a narrower focus. For example, the role of water for producing food but also for regulating the climate; or the impact of land use change on biodiversity but also on the importance of biodiversity to enhance production, such as through pollinated crops or multiple ecosystem services in forestry. Thus, from many lines of research, important conclusions are communicated to policymakers which may add up to enough evidence to implement changes. Biodiversity is such an example, which, although being an extremely complex issue, has gained enough support to make its value heard in global governance, which has resulted in several major treaties that concern biodiversity conservation, for example the UN Convention on Biodiversity. Thus, while we may lack a completely integrated picture, the adaptive multi-level nature of governance and the continuous dialog between science, policymakers, NGO’s and the public, is working towards a new understanding of human development from the bottom up. But as Kate Raworth tells us in the talk below, the main language that drives global human activity today is economics and it is thus of paramount importance that the crucial insights of planetary boundaries and linked social-ecological systems are acknowledged in economic theory and applications."

As we will see below, there can be major consequences through the choice of value for the discount rate and a real challenge is that the discount rate is to some degree subjective involving aspects of morale and personality."

A blunt approach is simply to use the current economic discount rate, e.g. used by federal banks. This implies that any amount of money (or time that could have been spent earning money) could instead have been invested in a bank account to receive the benefit of the interest rate over time. On the other hand, one can argue that for public goods (such as biodiversity, climate stabilization, poverty alleviation), future value should be equal or even higher than contemporary value in order to promote sustainable development and for ethical responsibility towards future generations. So, do we use a positive, negative or zero discount rate? A positive discount rate is appropriate for infrastructure that has a limited technical life-time, whereas investments in natural capital have no such inherent limitation. Furthermore, investments in natural capital and poverty alleviation can be regarded as a transfer of wealth to the future, rather than an investment to enhance the wealth of the present generation. If we believe future generations should be at least as wealthy as we are today it makes sense to use <b>zero discount rate</b> for such investments. Doing so will make these investments in sustainable development look more profitable in economic analyses, because future benefits are not discounted. In his famous study from 2006, Nicholas Stern used a lower than usual (but not zero) discount rate on investments for reducing fossil fuels and was therefore able to show that this kind of investment would be very profitable."

				"text": "<h1>The discounting debate</h1>A sure sign that sustainability is to a large degree an ethical question can be traced by the very active debate on how to value future costs and benefits. The debate was invigorated by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern_Review\">Stern review</a> that attempted to provide a cost analysis for climate change impact. This was done to support decision making about whether the reduction of future costs due to climate change could be justified by the perceived high cost of immediate mitigation investments, i.e. answering the question: is it economically effective to curb climate change today in order to avoid future costs?"
			},
			{
				"text": "Since we can be almost certain that the future costs will be much higher than potential remedies today it begs the question why this is an issue at all. The reason lies in how we perceive the future. There are at least two aspects to this: First, uncertainty about the future. Do we know what will happen? How will economic development proceed? how big will the climate impact will actually be? and more importantly will we live to see the future? Secondly, IF we know all this, how much is some benefit worth today if you would receive it some time in the future? This last point is also highly subjective and depends on the framing and context of the question. For example:<ul><li>How much would I have to give you in one year for you to wait that time if you could instead get 1000SEK today?</li><li>How much would I have to give you in one+10 years for you to wait that time if you could instead get 1000SEK in ten years?</li><li>How much would I have to give your children in 20 years for you to decline an offer of 1000SEK today?</li></ul>If you can imagine a number for each of these 3 questions you could calculate your own discount rate and most likely, it would differ between each of the three scenarios. Thus, we can state that the value of the future depends on who makes the decision, who gets the benefits, and the time scale of the problem.<br> Let us look at these questions by looking more deeply into the vibrant debate following the Stern report:"
			},

				"text": "<h1>The discounting formula</h1>National economics generally uses a formula for the discount rate based on the “Ramsey” equation:d=g+nC, Where d is the social discount rate, g is the pure rate of time preference, n determines the relative importance of economic growth, C. The higher the d value that we end up with, the less importance is placed on future costs or benefits. There are two main terms, the rate of pure time preference, g, and the wealth-based component, n C. The first one asks an ethical question: how important are future generations compared to the current one? Zero would mean of equal importance, negative would mean more important and positive would mean less important."
			},
			{
				"text": "Stern argued for equal worth, equal rights and living conditions for all generations of people, implying that the pure time preference should be zero. However, he added a small term of 0.1% to account for the fact that potentially, humans might not even exist in the future due to manmade or natural disasters! Other economists argue that the pure time preference can be revealed by our current behavior, i.e. if g would really be zero, wouldn’t we save a lot more of our current income for the future?"
			},
			{
				"text": "Partha Dasgupta frames the “Ramsey” equation in a somewhat different way: He suggest thinking of, g, as the tradeoff between current and future generations, and n to be the tradeoff between the rich and the poor, a higher, n, meaning a greater discern for the poor. Note, however, that a higher n in conjunction with a high growth rate of the economy gives a higher total discount rate. Thus, even though we try to be more equitable by choosing a higher, n, we would actually invest less in the future since we value it lower! This comes from the fact that due to the assumption of economic growth, future generations will be “richer” than we are today, thus we can compensate for this by investing less in the future. BUT this hinges on a crucial assumption: positive economic growth. What if we have reached peak-growth? What if the effects of the Great Acceleration are now catching up, reducing the total production base and creating a world in which the economy is constant or even reduces? This will largely depend on how we calculate economic growth; particularly whether we include social and environmental stocks as we have discussed in the previous sections. In fact, if the economy would start to shrink, the total discount rate might easily become negative suggesting that we should invest heavily now for the future."
			},
			{
				"text": "Kenneth Arrow, a Nobel laureate in economics adds to the debate that according to the calculations in the Stern report, climate mitigation would be efficient as long as the discount rate is less than 8.5%, which is higher than most suggest. Creating a debate about exact numbers seems somewhat obsolete in the face of actually getting to work. There remain to be questions surrounding the debate on pure time preference. In response to supporters of higher pure time preferences, Stern suggests that the result of a time preference even as large as 1.5% would be basically be the same as anyone with grandchildren telling them that their lives are only half as important as your own."

For example, we can study one organism, which is a system of organs, and its relation to the external environment, like temperature. In theory, a warm blooded organism does also affect the environmental temperature, but we determine that the interaction strength going from the organism to the environment is sufficiently low as to treat is as an external factor. Another common reason for studying systems is an interest in interactions between components, or an interest in a phenomenon that is a consequence of the collective dynamics of the parts.

Increasing this scale would e.g. be to allow to include the interactions of the persons that our focus person interacts with, i.e. to follow the social network two steps.

This is a shift in scale in the “aggregated” direction. We can increase the vertical or aggregated scale to look at which interaction a person has with people from 1) different neighborhoods, 2) municipalities, 3) countries.

At the individual level (focusing on social structure only), one could see that even though clusters, (or modules) where distinctively different from each other, they also showed occupational diversity."

This may partly explain why the community has been unsuccessful in regulating resource extraction, especially since potentially influential groups of non-fishermen have a limited communication with the various fisher groups. Analysis of network structure also shows that groups most central, and hence potentially most influential, are dominated in numbers by migrant deep sea fishermen, hypothetically less motivated to initiate collective action for resource management. Hence, we conclude that a lack of collective action to remedy an unsustainable situation may be attributed to various different but distinct aspects of the specific structure of the social network."

This can be interpreted as resource sharing and competition is, in this study area, often accompanied with social connectivity that increases the potential for negotiating and regulating resource use. Secondly, the motif with all possible connections among the four nodes being realized (III.D) is also overrepresented. Hence, if the clans are sharing two patches, these patches are relatively often also ecologically connected, as are the clans. Thus, highly interconnected clusters of clans and forest patches are relatively common in the network. Taken together, by analyzing the motif-based SES fingerprint of the social–ecological network defining the study area, they were able to come up with some pending hypotheses that could partly explain the successful governance of the biodiversity rich forest patches. The clans are organized in relation to the forest patches so that shared forests are combined with social connectivity, which is a cornerstone of successful common-pool resource management as discussed earlier. Furthermore, there are several indications of a good fit in terms of social and ecological connectivity although this pattern is less pronounced."

They have been documented in a wide range of systems including financial markets, climate, the brain, social networks and ecosystems. Regime shifts in ecosystems are policy relevant because they can affect the flow of ecosystem services that societies rely upon, they are very difficult to predict and often hard to impossible to reverse (Rocha et al. 2012)."

Controversial examples include dryland degradation or the shift from forest to savannas, where we know they can happen but we do not fully understand their mechanisms and there are disagreements about their drivers. Proposed examples of regime shifts includes the weakening of the Indian Monsoon or the weakening of the Thermohaline circulation in the ocean. We know both can happen from paleological records, but to what extent they are likely under present conditions is less understood."

				"text": "What these phenomena have in common is that their scientific understanding relies on the same mathematical theory of dynamic systems. The behavior of a system can be described by a set of equations that define all possible values of their variables, for instance coral cover or fish abundance. These systems tend to fluctuate around regions of the parameter space that are called equilibrium or basins of attraction. Systems prone to regime shifts have more than one domain of attraction; this means that roughly under the same parameter values they can suddenly shift from one domain to another when a critical threshold is crossed. Note that these domains of attraction or regimes are not punctuated equilibriums, they are dynamic, they fluctuate within the boundaries of the basin of attraction. Thus for example, a forest is never the same forest twice: the species composition, their abundance and distribution is always changing as the forest endures fires, hard winters, storms or pests outbreaks. Yet its identity can always be characterized as a forest. The same can be said of any regime."

				"text": "However, a regime shift does not imply any change of an ecosystem, it has to affect the feedback structure of the system that maintain its stability and emergent properties; this is, a change that effects its identity (eg. Forest, coral reef, mangrove). Scientist when they refer to regime shifts often emphasize that they are abrupt and persistent changes. It worth noticing that the abruptness and persistence are relative to the dynamics defining the system’s identity. Back to the forest example, one generation of trees can last hundreds of years, then a change over the time span of a decade is abrupt from the forest perspective."

				"text": "<h1>History of the concept and evidence</h1>First notions of systems that can have multiple attractors date back to 1885 when Henri Poincaré first described bifurcations. However, only until late 1960s these mathematical developments were introduced to ecology when leading scientist debated about stability in ecosystems (Holling 1973, Lewontin 1969), which lead to the first theoretical developments, often models, of potential regime shifts in fisheries, disease outbreaks, and grazing – harvesting systems. These early developments were criticized by the lack of empirical evidence in the 1980s, but by early 2000s enough evidence have accumulated on systems such as coral reefs and lakes, validating the existence of regime shifts and igniting further research on their detection and management (Scheffer et al. 1001, Folke et al 2004, Scheffer and Carpenter 2003)). Nowadays there are still some differences on how the concept is used across disciplinary fields. For example, while oceanographers consider a regime shift a phenomenon on the scales of decades that has to be driven by climate, marine biologist focus on the time span of key species life cycles."

				"text": "<h1>Why are regime shifts hard to detect and costly to reverse?</h1>Empirical and theoretical developments have shown that regime shifts are hard to detect and sometimes hard or impossible to reverse. Change in slow variables (e.g. temperature in coral reefs, nutrients accumulation in lakes) often shrinks the basin of attraction, making the system more susceptible to shifting when exposed to shock events (e.g. hurricanes, storms) or the action of external drivers. When the shift occur the strength of feedbacks change and some times new feedbacks mechanism come to place, making difficult to restore the original system state. This difficulty is often termed ‘hysteresis’; this mean that the critical tipping point at which the system flip from one regime to another is not the same at which the system is expected to flip back."
			},
			{
				"text": "An illustrative example is eutrophication, the shift from clear to murky waters in lakes. The most common driver of eutrophication is the accumulation of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous, although it has been reported that it can also by caused by climate change alone. Excess of nutrients in the water often come from the use of fertilizers when growing food. Nutrients are naturally present in the soil and in combination with other indirect drivers such as deforestation, nutrient inputs both natural and anthropogenic can accelerate when rain comes and wash the soils. Nutrients accumulate on lake sediments and are kept by rooted plants. But when a threshold of nutrients on the water is transpassed, microalgae growth explodes creating algae booms. These booms reduce light penetration to the bottom of the lake, which reduces the ability of rooted plants to survive. With less rooted plants the nutrients accumulated on sediments are resuspended on the water column, reinforcing the original cause of the algae blooms. This is a new reinforcing feedback in place that makes the regime shift hard to reverse. Figure 1 shows the structure of the system by summarizing the key feedbacks that maintain the clear water regime or the eutrophic state respectively."

			{
				"text": "Detecting regime shifts is a challenging task. First one needs to clearly define the boundaries of the system and select focus variables that serve as indicators of the system state. Data requirements will depend directly on the spatial and temporal scales at which the underlying feedback mechanisms operate. Sometimes regime shifts are identifiable from historical data by looking at jumps on the time series; however statistical techniques are required to test whether it was a real regime shift. Amongst the most common test used are the principal component analysis, which compresses several time series of related variables into few uncorrelated ones; chronological clustering, sequential t-tests. Recent efforts on improving prediction rather than detection from past events have been focusing on the development of early warning signals (Scheffer et al 2012). They are based on the statistical signature of a system approaching a regime shift called critical slowing down which can be observed on the increased autocorrelation (temporal or spatial) and skewness while decrease in variance."
			},
			{
				"text": "<h1>How to manage regime shifts?</h1>Managing regime shifts implies both reversing the shift and avoiding them. In order to restore the system one has to manage the slow variables and bring them to a point well bellow the critical tipping point in order to broaden again the basin of attraction. In addition, active management is needed to weaken the feedbacks that keep the system locked on the undesirable regime while strengthening the feedbacks that will provide stability on the desirable one. Back to the example of eutrophication, lake management often requires reducing nutrient inputs to a level lower than originally required for the system to flip. This not only means reduction of fertilizers use, it also means locking nitrogen already present in the lake by using other substances such as iron to waken the nutrient recycling feedback. Other options include bio-manipulation, this is artificially increasing the abundance of species that will consume microalgae to avoid the likelihood of more algae blooms; or direct removal of sediments by dragging."
			},
			{
				"text": "Improving resilience to regime shifts requires enhancing diversity. From the biological perspective it is often translated into functional groups, this is, set of species that perform more or less the same function on an ecosystem. On the eutrophication example, by increasing the abundance of species that feed on microalgae and reducing the species that feed on rooted plants, one can promote a shift back from a eutrophic state. Two important components of functional groups are response diversity and redundancy: while the former is the different responses that species have to environmental change, the later refers to the ability of certain species to replace others. But these basic notions of diversity are not only applicable to biological systems, one can think of diversity in society as an important component to build resilience to regime shifts. It translates to diversity of livelihoods, or different types of knowledge taken into account in decision-making."
			},
			{
				"text": "Another important component to build resilience is spatial heterogeneity. The influence of drivers and some times feedback strength is not homogeneous in space, providing the opportunity to use spatial heterogeneity to reduce risk. For example, degraded coral reefs that have shifted to algae-dominated could be recolonized by adjacent coral patches. Similarly, fishermen who spread their pressure on marine systems across space and let areas protected or closed for recovery are less likely to collapse their resources."

The temperature change in the Holocene was a remarkably stable period, and we know that today, as before the Holocene, temperatures changed at a much faster rate. Forest biomass accumulates slowly, while phytoplankton biomass can have several bloom and die-offs in one season. Is there a general way of understanding such dynamics in systems? To understand this, we will have to look at what mechanisms drive change."
			},
			{
				"text": "<h1>Slow change</h1><h2>Integrative or accumulative change.</h2>The most fundamental slow variable in systems is the integration of some quantity over time by small additions. For example, lakes receive nutrient input e.g. from fertilizer use in the surrounding agricultural land within the drainage basin thus increasing the primary production in the lake. Nutrients are trapped in biomass and eventually living organisms die and the dead material settle to the bottom and become part of the sediment. Over time, the total stock of nutrients in the sediment increases and some fraction is regenerated into the water. This process is much slower than the dynamics of the phytoplankton. A lake with high nutrient release from the sediment become more prone to algal blooms than one that does not have a large sediment nutrient reservoir. Thus, the dynamics of the lake changes over time, driven by a slow variable, the nutrient content of the sediment. As we will see below, this can trigger fast changes and lead to critical transitions."

			{
				"text": "Other potential integrative or accumulative changes include wealth, experience and knowledge, regulations (think of the ever increasing size of most nations law books, or the bureaucratization of many organizations over time), urban populations etc. All of these examples constitute changes that are almost un-noticeable with each increment, but will change the system properties and behavior in the long term."

			{
				"text": "<h2>Adaptive or compositional change</h2>When a selective process slowly acts to change the components of a system according to some non-random scheme, the nature of the system is fundamentally altered, albeit slowly and in incremental steps. In contrast to the integrative change mentioned above, the characteristics of adaptive change is by replacement, rather than addition. Markets are a good example that experience adaptive change through competition. Given a certain demand some products are more desired than others. People make a choice, rather than accumulating all products. This led to the rise to a higher percentage of SUV cars in the whole car fleet in the last decade. Similarly, species compete for limited resources and as the environment changes, the species community may change without changing the total number of individuals."

				"text": "Consider again, the car fleet of a city. Different policies affect the decision of car buyers and the range of cars buyers can choose from. Many cities that restrict fuel-inefficient cars and provide incentives for efficient or even electric cars are slowly changing the economic infrastructure. The market adapts and starts to provide electric fueling stations. In the hopefully not too distant future, the choice of an electric car will overcome the impracticality and cost hurdle of owning a car that needs special stations for fueling and that has a larger upfront cost. The slow variable is the increasing demand for electric fueling stations and the marked responds with increasing supply, thus lowering the price and increasing the availability. It is not unforeseeable that when the next oil crisis strikes, these cities will be among the first that experience a dramatic shift as the cost/benefit ratio for different car types. The difference to the integrative change mentioned above is that this change can occur even if the total quantity of cars does not change, just the composition of the car fleet. We can think of this as competitive or exclusionary change, as the choice of one type of car by one buyer excludes the choice on another type."

The measure of interest here are network related properties, such as average link density, mean path length, compartmentalization or other network scale indices. When networks form, either through new interactions (links) and/or new agents (nodes), the structure of the network changes and can have profound effects on the inherent dynamics of the system itself. A good example is the spread of epidemics, e.g. both biological and computer viruses. As link densities in the network of human physical interactions increase (more people to encounter) as well as the distances we travel, simple models of epidemic spread predict more rapid spread and a larger proportion of the global population being infected. In 2010, roughly 30 percent of the western population could afford to travel long distance and only 5% of the non-western population. In 2030 this is going to change to 40% of the western population and a staggering 2 billion people from the non-western countries. This change in the travel network structure of the human population has vast implications for the human-infectious disease system"

When the iphone was first released and the app store opened its doors to independent developers, the news where full of dramatic success stories: simple ingenious applications where bought by masses and provided earnings unheard of for independent developers. In forest clearcut, plants, such as the Fireweed, can quickly spread into the area and become dominant. It is well know from organizational research that often the phase just after creating a new organization with a new purpose will be the most productive and creative. Few constraints are in place, little competition for funding, space etc hinders organizational members for being at their full potential. In this situation, it is the initial setup of people that determines the performance of the whole organization. As competitive processes come into play (space, money, leadership), and members are exchanged according to group-determined or leadership criteria, many organizations become burdened by the transactions cost of dealing with the tensions of these competitive processes and lose momentum, slowly transitioning into the slow change dynamics outlined above. Thus, fast change triggered by reduced limitations is a fundamental system dynamics phenomena."

We can take the example of weather vs climate change. A plant community is structured by the historical long term climate conditions at its location. But weather varies largely around these within and between years. This variation is to a large extent internalized into the community and plants have adapted strategies to cope with short term changes in precipitation and temperatures. While year to year changes in weather will have effect on the next year composition of the community, seed banks and overwintering plant tissue buffers these variations. It is when the change persists long enough, or climate changes directionally that we can start to speak about a disturbance. Thus, one needs to define disturbance in relation to the capacity of the system to adapt to the change in question. The rate of climate change, varies for different biomes and locations around the planet."

The rate of northward tree migration during the Holocene is estimated at about 1 km yr-1 after the last glacial maximum in Europe and North America. The apparent paradox of such a fast migration rate relative to the limitations on plant dispersal is possible by rare long-distance migration events or high latitude refugia reseeding the landscape. The latter means that post-glacial re-colonization velocities may have been as much as an order of magnitude slower than previously thought (~0.1 km yr-1). For the latter estimate one can see that many biomes around the globe are experiencing a climate change disturbance."

In boreal forests, this happens in small enough patches at long enough intervals that most species have not special adaptations to this.

				"text": "<h2>Disorganization</h2>Over time, systems self organize through the slow changes mentioned above. Biomass is accumulated, new species enter the system and become part of the food-web network and abiotic components such as soil, nutrients, water are affected. Rainforests, for example, have established a very tight feedback for nutrients and also function as self-reinforcing the precipitation due to the enormous evapotranspiration from leaf biomass. Thus, every species becomes dependent on the system properties. Evolutionary specialization over long time scales create very specific interactions between particular species, fostering diversity but also interdependence. When large disturbances occur, such as deforestation of the Amazon forest, disrupting nutrient and water cycling, the network unravels. Such disturbances, when ignoring the fact that in this case it is an undesired act, also open opportunities for new species which can shape the local environment into new ecosystem types. In social systems, revolutions are social disturbances, triggered by resentment and collective action. When governments fall, and nations enter a disorganized state, the system is open for new actors that build new systems of power and governance. That this process not always goes as anticipated, is well examplified by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring\">arab spring.</a>"

				"text": "<h2>Reorganization</h2>When a disturbance has hit a system it is often open for reorganization. But legacies may persist that reduce the chance of another system configuration to emerge. Seed banks are like a memory of species past and can be activated by large changes. When hot temperatures kill coral reefs, coral skeletons increase the change of establishment of new corals. But sometimes, these legacies are not enough and new configurations emerge. Disturbances and reorganizations are not per se a negative change. Sometimes a social ecological system can be trapped in an undesired state and one can use disturbance and reorganization to transition into a more desired regime. In southern Sweden, there is a town called Kristianstad. It’s an old military town which is known for heavy industry. When the military compound was shut down, and industries moved out, the town region experienced a disturbance. In its region there was a lot of wetland areas generally thought of as a “water sick” area of little use. Nature conservationists had already before the disturbance organized into social networks covering both horizontal (among people and conservation organizations) and vertical (into government) scales. When the disturbance hit, the system was sensitive to a reorganization. Through lobbying, the notion of Kristianstad as a “Water-kingdom” was established and its beautiful wetlands are now one of its signature marks."

				"text": "<h1>Biodiversity</h1>There is a direct connection between human well-being and biodiversity. The most apparent connection is through the biodiversity support for all ecosystem services (e.g. Chapin et al., 2000), but there are also linkages through the evolutionary genesis of biodiversity together with the ecological processes underlying patterns and trends (Levin, 2000). However, the relation between biodiversity, understood as species diversity, and ecosystem service generation is not necessarily strongly correlated (Naidoo et al., 2008). Reframing biodiversity as functional diversity may help, as functional diversity is based on functional traits, i.e. physical or behavioural characters that can have a direct influence on ecosystem service generation. Functional traits can be divided into two categories relevant for discussing present and future ecosystem performance (Gonzalez and Loreau, 2009). Effect traits relate to the different functions, while response traits indicate how organisms may respond to different environmental conditions and changes. Response diversity, i.e. variation within response traits (sensu Elmqvist et al., 2003), has been suggested to be the most effective approach for preservation of those aspects of functional diversity that benefit humans (Mori et al., 2013). That said, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning cannot be revealed by ecological studies of communities that focus on the structure and behaviour of species and populations alone. Beyond individual traits or trait combinations, information is needed on the flux of energy and matter through the ecosystem and causal process change behind a final outcome that could become a service – under certain circumstances."

				"text": "<h1>Service Providing Units</h1>Understanding the ecological processes that can potentially generate ecosystem services will help planners and management facilitate the translation and realization of ecological processes into services. Processes can be traced back to the places and units in which they take place, e.g. photosynthesis and primary production in plants or the interaction between a pollinator and a crop needing pollination (Burkhard et al., 2009; Luck et al., 2003). These service providing units have can be analysed and understood in terms of internal qualities and location specific context. Depending on the type of service, internal qualities relate thresholds in size or level of ecological organization (species, community, ecosystem), as well as temporal dynamics (many services only exist at specific times). Different dimensions of context (socio-technological, environmental, ecological and cultural, see Andersson et al., 2014) will influence the output from the service providing unit by either promoting or suppressing service realization. Knowing where services come from and landscape changes that may affect service delivery is key to the operationalization and use ecosystem services in planning."

			{
				"text": "<h1>Multifunctional landscapes and bundles of ecosystem services</h1>As already indicated, most landscapes are multifunctional in the sense that they provide more than one ecosystem service. Drivers of change as well as different management regimes can have effects limited to a single service but are far more likely to have multiple impacts, many of them indirect. The connection or co-occurrence of services has been approached through an analytical focus on bundles of services (Foley et al., 2005; Raudsepp-Hearne et al., 2010), and including many services in analyses and assessments is essential for identifying trade-offs and synergies within decision making. Using a more mechanistic understanding of ecosystem service generation, for example through the service providing unit approach above, will help explain the roots of multi-functionality, or at the very least, the environmental aspect of multifunctionality. With the added understanding of scale and context dependence we can advance our understanding of when bundles of ecosystem services unravel as a consequence of reducing the size of an area (as there might be thresholds) or the wider implications of land use change (e.g. loss of local biodiversity due to regional fragmentation of green infrastructure)."

As a parallel to the supply and demand side of markets ecosystem services can thus be understood as the final outcome of potential and utilization. The social-ecological systems perspective highlights also how e.g. social institutions and cultural practices have been influenced by and co-evolved with the utilization of ecosystem services (e.g. Colding and Folke, 2001; Ostrom, 1990, 1999)."

In a decision making context, monetary valuation can be designed to contribute the marginal values needed for cost—benefit analyses (e.g. Naidoo and Ricketts, 2006) which could potentially inform many policy decisions (Arrow et al., 1996). However, most ecosystem services have additional non-material or intangible dimensions (Chan et al., 2012). In some cases, these intangible dimensions can matter more to people than do the affiliated material benefits (money and desirable physical changes such as sustenance or shelter). For example, owning and working in forest provides timber but may also be a way of life with ethical, political, or spiritual aspects. An ecosystem service approach in an area where forestry is an important livelihood should explicitly include ecosystems’ contribution to valued ways of life through well-being, sense of stewardship and identity etc., in addition to the concurrent income generating service.<br>Valuation is therefore expressed in two forms:<ul><li>Monetary</li><li>Non-monetary</li></ul>To get a deeper problematization of the issue of monetary vs non-monetary valuation of ecosystem services, see this lecture by Thomas Hahn on the topic:"

				"text": "<h1>Causes of land use change</h1>Before we proceed to a video lecture on land use change at the bottom of this page, lets look at the main causes that lead to this phenomena. The basic unit of change are the people or households that have access to a piece of land, whether by property rights or not. These people are involved in a decision making process, i.e. how to extract utility from a parcel of land. This decision process is influenced by both environmental factors as well as social, including economic forces, which can range across a wide range of spatial scales. Eric Lambin, a recent Volvo environmental prize winner, divides causes of land use change into proximate causes (direct and local) and underlying causes (indirect or root). The__ proximate causes__ relate to why and how people make their decisions that lead to change in land cover and ecosystem processes, while the underlying causes explain the socio-environmental context in which these decisions are made. The later are typically exogenous and originate at larger scales than the former. Lets look at some important proposed causes:<ul><li><b>Environmental variability</b>, both fast as well as long term change the conditions and opportunities for local people. A slow drying of an area may increase the risk of dry spells while people are slow to adapt to new conditions, causing crop failures which may force them to harvest resources from the surrounding ecosystems, thereby potentially degrading them as exemplified in the Tanzania food production system case.</li><li><b>Changes in population size</b> affect the general pressure and intensity of land use. Migration can have dramatic effects in this respect. Also, many cities in developed countries have a sphere of influence into the surrounding rural areas where city dwellers keep rural properties with different land use patterns than corresponding rural-only dwellers.</li><li><b>Institutions</b> that regulate land use access or behavior can have dramatic effects on a landscape as shown in the picture below from New Zealand’s Mount Taranaki. Other institutional arrangements, such as subsidies can dramatically change the land use in entire regions. In Southern Madagascar, patches of forests are sustained in a savannah landscape due to religious institutions as burial sites are exempted from any use (see figure below).</li><li><b>Cultural aspects</b> on land use include traditions and can be quite resilient to change for good and bad. Cultural change, such as empowerment of women, can change patterns of land use</li><li><b>Globalization</b> is typically an underlying cause, shifting incentives driven by global demand and values. Developing countries demand for giant shrimp is, for example, an underlying cause for much of the deforestation of mangrove forests in Southeast Asia. But globalization can also reverse some negative impacts, such as the demand for sustainably grown coffee.</li></ul>"

The processes that increase biodiversity have to do with niche-variation in time, space or aspect. Variation in time promotes coexistence of species as they can can be superior competitiors at different times, such as spring or summer plants. Variation in space promotes diversity as species can live close to each other if there are different habitats close by, such as edges around rivers and agricultural fields. Variation in aspect promotes biodiversity by one species providing the niche for another. Plants provide the niche for herbivores that provide the niche for predators. Different kind of plants provide niches for different kind of herbvores and so on. So, in general, we can say variation in space and time provides the process that increases biodiversity. But what was the main reson for humans to build infrastructure? To reduce variation and increase predictability! So it is easy to see, how human development goes against the preconditions for biodiversity."

Given the loose definition we have given to markets above one might at first be inclined to think so. However this need not be the case. In the late history of economic thinking, economists have commonly preferred to distinguish normative economics (“what ought to be” in economic matters) from positive economics (“what is”). In the definition above, we clearly made a normative value judgement in the sense that we related the market outcome to that of a benevolent planner, i.e. the market serves a goal. How are we to determine what is benevolent? Should poor countries contribute equally to rich countries when combating climate change? The answer is subjective and may depend on who you ask. The reason why economists have tried to separate the two is that in doing so it becomes clear what part of a suggested policy is related to value judgements (normative) and what is related to actual observations (positive). Hence, whether you are to consider an ideal market as a good thing, should depend upon whether you agree with the underlying ethics associated with the resulting market allocation (i.e. the income/wealth distribution or who gets what in the economy.). However, regardless of your opinion, understanding ideal markets should be your first stepping stone, which will enable you to uncover clues as to how markets could improve (or make worse) matters in situations where households, communities, and government don’t work so well."

To understand how prices affect supply and demand we need to use the concept of utility or usefulness, which is the (perceived) ability of something to satisfy needs or wants. Crucial for understanding markets is how utility changes with the quantity of a commodity that is exchanged. Particularly, we need to know how the utility of one additional unit of the commodity depends on the quantity, e.g. what is the difference in usefulness of one additional pack of milk when you buy one pack versus when you buy 10 packs. It is generally assumed that this utility, called marginal utility, decreases asymptotically with quantity. Marginal utility is the change in utility at any given amount of commodity X. If we can quantify utility in monetary terms, we can then easily read out from this graph what quantity corresponds to a certain price. We illustrate this in the picture below."

The equivalent of the buyer’s marginal utility for the supply side is the marginal cost of production, i.e. how much more would it cost to produce another item of the commodity depending on how much is produced in total. How do we expect this curve to look? One way of thinking about this is that production per unit decreases with quantity which is often true for commodities based on assembling raw products, i.e. the more raw product you buy the cheaper you get them. For a local fishermen, the amount of fish may on average be determined by the amount of time you spend. If this is the only consideration then one could expect a linear function. If, however, the cost of time increases the longer you fish, i.e. the lost opportunity cost increases as you have to forsake more and more important alternatives, you may get an increasing function."

However, in reality this is not the case here and the reason is due to the historical development of the concept of supply and demand. Both consumers and suppliers will adjust the quantity bought or produced based on the expected prices, thus price, on the y-axis, is the driver for quantity bought or sold on the x-axis. Price elasticity is commonly used to describe the change in this behavior driven by prices. If elasticity is zero, then no change in quantity bought/produced occurs as price changes. Positive elasticity means more is bought/produced as prices increases, and the opposite for negative elasticity. Understanding price elasticities can help understand to what degree markets can affect e.g. food security and nutrition among poor people."

If the price is higher than the intersection of supply and demand, consumers will buy less than producers supply. This will, in the next step induce a reduction in price from the supplier side which in turn increases consumption. This is an adaptive and iterative process. You can see that over time, the market system would tend towards an equilibrium (the grey arrows). Try to move the price (you can grab the orange line) down towards the equilibrium, the green point. Now assume that something changes, new production technologies, or alternative goods that affect the marginal utility of the supplier and consumer respectively. You can simulate this by moving e.g. the red or blue cross. Now the market should be off equilibrium again, but the adaptive process will ensure the price dynamics try to catch up with the new equilibrium. The green point acts as an attractor for the system, and due to the fact that supply and demand curves can change over time, we can think of the green point as a dynamic attractor."

				"text": "<h1>Market equilibrium?</h1>In the classical economic textbooks, one can calculate the conditions for stability of prices under the assumption of complete market clearance. However, this approach is often unstable and only under very specific shapes of the demand and supply curves does the model converge to a stable price. In fact, a better perspective is to forget about equilibrium altogether and think of the market as an adaptive system. The main assumption of equilibrium, i.e. perfect market clearance, is very seldom the case and both producers and consumers adapt their strategies in a more stepwise manner rather than assuming they have complete understanding of the response of consumers or suppliers. The adaptive process is much more stable in converging towards a price where supply and demand meet (called an attractor). Note however, that due to shifting preferences, technological change or other external factors, the shape of the supply and demand curves constantly change and thus the endpoint of the price (i.e. the attractor). Thus, prices are in practice always dynamic, but the adaptive change explains why the markets are so good at tracking this change, albeit with a slight delay. In very fast markets, such as stock trading where autonomous software makes decisions in nanoseconds, the prices reflect almost instant changes in the demand and supply."

What about biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES)? To a large extent it is beneficial for farmers if there are pollinating insects and if aphids and weeds are controlled by “natural enemies,” such as birds and insects, so that the farmer need not to use pesticides. If it was only a private benefit there would be no reason for society to subsidise it."
			},
			{
				"text": "However, biodiversity and ES are also public goods since a large part of the benefits cannot be reaped by the farmers. Biodiversity and ES are both an input to agriculture, because they increase harvest and the resilience to various disturbances; and an output from agriculture, because farming can have positive or negative effects on biodiversity, water quality, soil carbon, frequency of pollinating insects, etc. And these outputs are to a large extent external costs and external benefits. But a farmer should not have to pay for the production of public goods if it reduces his income from using his land for production."
			},
			{
				"text": "This justifies policies, both carrots and sticks. Carrots are both taxes and subsidies that leave the decision to farmers but try to influence behaviour. Sticks are quantitative regulations and prohibitions from using dangerous pesticides, especially near water. In Europe, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) supports organic farming, grasslands and other land-use that is believed to enhance biodiversity and several ES."
			},
			{
				"text": "In the figure below we assume that the demand (willingness-to-pay) for grasslands is substantially higher for the public (red line) than for the individual farmer (green line); it is mainly an external benefit of keeping open landscape with high biodiversity values. It is also a public good because the benefit is enjoyed in a way that does not reduce the benefits for others. We assume that the benefit from grasslands decreases with the area of grasslands since not all grassland is needed to produce the benefits. In reality this curve is probably non-linear but we keep it linear for simplicity. The cost in this case is the opportunity cost, i.e. forgone net benefits of using the land for the best alternative management such as crop production. If the best alternative is to produce wheat, then the cost of producing a grassland is the cost of the grassland plus the forgone net benefit of wheat. A stony permanent natural pasture is of little value (to the farmer) for wheat but the farmer may plant spruce or other trees if society does not pay her to produce grassland."
			},
			{
				"text": "The demand of the farmer and the demand of society should be added vertically, instead of horizontally as e.g. for wheat and beef. The optimal supply of grasslands corresponds to a 100% payment. This will generate a consumer surplus for society and a producer surplus for the farmer(s) because some grasslands can be provided at a low cost."
			},
			{
				"text": "The implicit assumption in this reasoning is that farmers have property rights to decide on land-use. The state therefore has to ‘bribe’ the farmer to choose an alternative land-use, which sometimes is called the ‘producer-receives-principle’ (PRP). A reverse situation would be that the government only allowed land-use with little negative externalities and that the farmer would need to pay a fee (economists often use the word ‘bribe’) to plant wheat instead (assuming wheat was associated with nitrogen leakage). This could be justified by the more common polluter-pays-principle (PPP). However, according to the Swedish Constitution 2:15, farmers have the right to continue on-going land-use and if the government wants to interfere they need to pay full compensation and can only do so if it is in the public’s best interest."

Often, the process is further facilitated by bridging organizations with the intention to make these connections."

While rigorous analysis of the success or failure of this approach are still scarce, we will here look at some of the available data. In an important study by Joshua Cinner et al. (2012) where 42 comanagement arrangements in artisanal fisheries across five countries were evaluated. Importantly, both ecological and social factors were included in this study. In the figure to the left they compare standing biomass in no-take fisheries closures, comanaged fisheries, and sites with no local management. Levels of fish biomass are demonstrably higher in comanaged areas than in comparable open-access reef fisheries, but no-take fishery closures have the highest expected biomass. When looking at the social side of comanagement the picture becomes more diverse:"

In short, a biosphere region is focused around a highly valuable natural asset with zones of core protection, buffer and transition that benefit from each other socioeconomically while increasing the understanding and value of the core.
