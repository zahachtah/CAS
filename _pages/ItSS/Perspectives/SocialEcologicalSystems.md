One of the most important perspectives to take is that of seeing humans are being a part of nature. While we have an unproportional impact on the planet since some centuries back and while we have successfully managed to put more and more steps between us and natures benefits (grocery stores, energy production etc...), we still need food, water, air, shelter and connection. To understand that our wellbeing is unseparabale from the health of the ecosystems around us is embedded in taking a social-ecological systems view.

Resilience starts from the belief that humans and nature are strongly coupled to the point that they should be conceived as one social-ecological system. This means that in our globalized society, there are virtually no ecosystems that are not shaped by people and no people without the need for ecosystems and the services they provide. People and nature are truly intertwined in what we refer to as social-ecological systems.

Social ecological systems are in turn complex adaptive systems composed of many diverse human and non-human entities that interact. They adapt to changes in their environment and their environment changes as a result.

A short introduction to the interactions and dependencies between humans and nature, or __Social-Ecological-Systems__, and what it means when we call them "complex adaptive systems"

In the second lecture we welcome Carl Folke, Science Director at the Stockholm Resilience Centre. He will talk about an important foundation for understanding the problems and solutions related to sustainability. __Humans and nature are one system__. The functioning of ecosystems is seen today as how the activities of humans locally and globally, and the goods and services ecosystems provide (whether direct, such as timber and fuel, or indirect, such as by regulating precipitation patterns that determine our agricultural abilities), are integral to society.

* Imagine your favorite nature spot. Now try to envision the institutional arrangements that provide the basis for its existence, the people that work to maintain or develop it and that may often have strong emotional ties to it.
* Try to envision social scenarios, such as changes in regulation or economic conditions that would drastically change the way your nature spot will develop.
