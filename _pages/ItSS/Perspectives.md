excerpt: "To understand and govern social ecological systems requires a trans-disciplinary approach. This entails not only understandings from different scientific disciplines but also the combination of different kinds of knowledge. The true value of trans-disciplinary approach comes not only from the meeting of people with different perspectives, but the deeper understanding that is created when one person engages in different perspectives"

intro:
  - excerpt: 'I have found it quite useful to think of complex adaptive systems by applying at least three different lenses to any problem: How is the **variation** of components expressed, what are the **scales** of interaction and how do the components **respond** to these interactions. But it is when we put these ingredients together in a stew we get the dynamics of complex adaptive systems. My friend and post-doc host [Simon Levin](https://www.princeton.edu/~slevin/) likes to describe complex adaptive systems as localized interactions that result in selection processes which manifests in patterns at higher levels that in turn determine the nature of the local interactions. Thus, in this website I will explore both the ingrediences of complex adaptive systems as well as the resulting patterns when all processes work in concert'
