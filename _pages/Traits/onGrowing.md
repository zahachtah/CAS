excerpt: "We have now left the extraordinary nurturing environment of the Holocene and are now for the first time responsible not only for humanity but also for the environment that provides the life-support system. Also, for the first time, we are aware of this"

intro:
  - excerpt: 'Ontogenetic development is fuelled by metabolism and occurs
primarily by cell division. Incoming energy and materials from the
environment are transported through hierarchical branching network
systems to supply all cells. These resources are transformed
into metabolic energy, which is used for life-sustaining activities.
During growth, some fraction of this energy is allocated to the
production of new tissue. Thus, the rate of energy transformation is
the sum of two terms, one of which represents the maintenance of
existing tissue, and the other, the creation of new tissue. This is
expressed by the conservation of energy equation: (West et al 2001)'
